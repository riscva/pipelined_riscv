A basic pipelined 32-bit riscv cpu. 

Written for self-education purposes. 

Taken from the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture (RISC-V Edition)" by Harris and Harris.

v1.0 Contains a hazard unit that deals with stalling, flushing and forwarding. Supports the instructions: add, sub, slt, sll, srl, and, or, xor, lw, sw, lui and beq.
